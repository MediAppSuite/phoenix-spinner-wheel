        The Fortune Wheel is a captivating game of chance that combines luck and
        anticipation. Participants eagerly gather around the wheel, eyes fixed
        on the colorful segments, each representing a potential outcome. The
        excitement builds as the wheel spins, and players hope for their chosen
        segment to be the final resting place of the elusive pointer. To ensure
        fair play and a smooth experience, certain conditions and rules govern
        the Fortune Wheel. Participants typically must adhere to a minimum and
        maximum bet requirement, ensuring a level playing field for all
        involved. Additionally, the wheel's design often incorporates equal
        spacing between segments, maintaining the randomness integral to the
        game. In some variations, specific rules dictate the consequences of
        landing on certain segments, such as bonus rounds, multipliers, or
        forfeitures. These conditions not only add an element of strategy but
        also contribute to the unpredictability that makes the Fortune Wheel a
        thrilling and engaging game for all.
